\noindent
Strain quantifies local deformation of a solid body. In medical imaging,
strain refects how tissue deforms under load. Or, it can quantify growth or
atrophy of tissue, such as the growth of a tumor. Additionally, strain from the
transformation that results from image-to-image registration can be applied as
an input to a biomechanical constitutive model.

This document describes N-dimensional computation of strain tensor images in
the Insight Toolkit (ITK), \url{www.itk.org}. Two filters are described. The
first filter computes a strain tensor image from a displacement field image.
The second filter computes a strain tensor image from a general spatial
transform. In both cases, infinitesimal, Green-Lagrangian, or Eulerian-Almansi
strain can be generated.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in
this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.

\section{Background}

The result of image registration is a spatial transformation that is sometimes
non-rigid. The spatial transformation's local deformation is quantified with
the \textit{strain tensor}. When registration occurs on images from multiple
time points, strain is a measure of local tissue growth or atrophy. For
example, strain can quantify the growth of a tumor or atrophy of cerebral gray
matter. When registration occurs on images of the same tissue that experience
mechanical stimulation, local strain quantifies the amount of local
deformation imparted on the tissue. For instance, compression and tension of
arterial plaque can be quantified from images of the arteries at multiple
points in the cardiac cycle. Finally, when combined with stress in a
constitutive model, the inverse problem can be solved to determined tissue
viscoelasticity. For example, stiffness of a cirrhotic liver can be imaged.

Strain is a symmetric second rank tensor. \textit{Infinitesimal strain}, also
called Cauchy's strain, linear strain, engineering strain, or small strain, is a
first order approximation to the Green-Lagrangian or Eulerian-Almansi strain
tensors. It is computed from the \textit{deformation gradient},
$\mathbf{F}$, as\cite{WikipediaStrainTheory}

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\varepsilon}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{F}^T+\mathbf{F}\right)-\mathbf{I}
\end{equation}

In tensor notation,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_{ij} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}\right)  \\
&=
\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{11} & \varepsilon_{12} & \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} & \varepsilon_{22} & \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} & \varepsilon_{32} & \varepsilon_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \\
&=
\left[\begin{matrix}
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}\right) & \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}\right) & \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} & \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}\right) & \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}\right) & \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The \textit{Green-Lagrangian} strain tensor, where displacement derivatives are
with respect to material coordinates, is,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E} = {1 \over 2} \left( \mathbf{F}^T \cdot \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{I} \right)
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
E_{ij} = {1 \over 2} \left( {\partial \, u_i \over \partial X_j} + {\partial \, u_j \over \partial X_i} +
                         {\partial \, u_k \over \partial X_i} {\partial \, u_k \over \partial X_j} \right)
\end{equation}

The \textit{Eulerian-Almansi} strain tensor, where displacement derivatives are
with respect to spatial coordinates, is,

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{e} = {1 \over 2} \left( \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{F}^T - \mathbf{I} \right)
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
e_{ij} = {1 \over 2} \left( {\partial \, U_i \over \partial x_j} + {\partial \, U_j \over \partial x_i} +
                         {\partial \, U_k \over \partial x_i} {\partial \, U_k \over \partial x_j} \right)
\end{equation}

Green-Lagrangian and Eulerian-Almansi are true mathematical tensors, i.e.,
they are invariant to translations or rotations of the coordinate system.

\section{Implementation}

The format of this LaTeX file, allows authors to include code snippets, like
the following

\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef itk::Image< unsigned char, 3 > ImageType;

ImageType::Pointer image = ImageType::New();
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

and to cite the online documentation of the Insitght Toolkit, for example, the
link to the doxygen documentation of the ImageToImageFilter

\doxygen{ImageToImageFilter}

LaTeX macros are also available for typesetting code in familiar courier fonts.
Like the following method of an ITK class.

\code{SetNumberOfIterations()}



% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:



\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, use markup like
this:

\begin{verbatim}
\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, ....


\section{This is another}

Just add another \section{}, but don't say \appendix again.
\end{verbatim}
